          Hosting for us is an expression of both our creativity and what is
          important to us. Sharing that with the people we love is one of the
          great joys of hosting an event. Welcome to Happy-Dayz, where you pour
          the essence of your event and creativity into an interactive space
          that serves as an extension to your events curated experience.
